## Ozone-GIF

Below is a visual (wait a minute or so for it to load...) created using this [NASA Climate Change Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/brsdincer/netcdf-information-and-analysis-climate-change/data) from Kaggle. In this case we are tracking ozone-depth over time and space.

This was a project to learn how to parse data in the `.nc4` or "netCDF" format. The jupyter notebook used to generate this visual can be found [here](https://github.com/Lewington-pitsos/3d-ozone/blob/gh-pages/netcdf-information-and-analysis-climate-change.ipynb).
